Two!Ears Auditory Front-End demo scripts
========================================

This folder contains demo and testing scripts intended
for both:
- validation of the code after modifications
- demonstration of code usage for new users

The figures of most "DEMO_XXX" scripts correspond to the figures in the 
section 4 of deliverable 2.2 (User manual). Some additional demos are 
present to illustrate some additional functionalities.

The sub-folder Development test scripts contains shorter 
scripts that were used during development to test 
particular features.
